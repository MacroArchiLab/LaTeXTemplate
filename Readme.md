## First time user

- If this is the first time you log in to this repository, please click on the green-colored dropdown button "< > Code" and choose "Create codespace on main" under the "Codespaces" tab.
- This will lead you to a new codespace opened in a new tab in your browser. The codespace is your workspace to write and edit the manuscript.
- Next time when you arrive to this repository and click on "< > Code", you will see the existing codespace you used previous time instead of asking you to create a new one. You can always continue using the codespace. The codespace is like a virtual computer. 
- After editing in the codespace, remember to push your changes to the repository.
